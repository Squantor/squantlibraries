# sqlibc
Minimal libc implementation. When I need a function that is a reimplementation of libc I put it here, together with its unittests. Next to standard libc functions it also contains non standard functions that would fit well in libc. Most if not all functions contain a few unittests, look in the directory test for those.
## Implemented parts
* TODO
  * more TODO

Moving over few functions from the squantlogger to here.
